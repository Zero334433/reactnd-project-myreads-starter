## Welcome to my MyReads React Project

This Project is based on the Udacity starter Project provided for all Students of the FEND course. All react code is written by me.

## Get Started

To get the App up and running you have to make sure to have NPM and Node installed. You did? Great, lets go! First clone the repository to your local machine. The download is finished? Now you navigate into the Project folder.
Run npm install and wait until its finished. Don't worry, it might take a littlebit of time. After the installation is finished start the app with npm start. A new browser window should open with the react app on screen. If not, or if you want to change the browser, just type localhost:3000 into your adress bar.
If the console throws an error make sure that there are no other servers running on port 3000.

## How the App works

Well, after a short moment the view should render and you should be able to see a few Books on screen in the different shelfes. If you want to put them in a different shelf or delete them all together, just press the green button and click on whichever shelf you want them to be in. At the bottom is another green button which will lead you to the search page where you can search for more books and add them to your shelfes. Have fun!

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
